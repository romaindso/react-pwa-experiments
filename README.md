Some experiments with Progressive Web Apps https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/

## Progressive Web App checklist

 * [x] Responsive design
 * [x] Offline capacity . The App Shell (UI skeleton) is loaded with service workers
 * [x] Installable - Allows users to "keep" apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
 * [x] Discoverable - Is identifiable as an "application" thanks to W3C manifest and service worker registration scope, allowing search engines to find it.
 * [x] Linkable - Easily share via URL, does not require complex installation.



## Todo
* [ ] Switch to Material Design for a better App-like style
* [ ] Deploy on github pages with HTTPS (let's encrypt)
* [ ] Re-engageable with push notifications
* [ ] Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
